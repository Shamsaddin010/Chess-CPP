### Guidelines

The documentation is divided into several sections with a different tone and purpose. If you plan to write more than a few sentences, you might find it helpful to get familiar with the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/reactjs/az.reactjs.org/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#guidelines-for-text) for the appropriate sections. Also don't forget to add comments in order for other developers to clearly understand the newly added code.
