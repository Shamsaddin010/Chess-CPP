### Guidelines

The code is divided into several sections with a different tone and purpose. If you plan to write more than a few sentences, you might find it helpful to get familiar with the [changes guidelines](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-clean-code-in-c/) for the appropriate sections. Also don't forget to add comments in order for other developers to clearly understand the newly added code.

## Make the change

1. Follow the Guidelines listed above
1. Save the files and check in the browser
1. If changes to code components in `main`, comments should be updated
1. If working with the UI, you may need to remove the `chess_pieces`.txt or renew it

## Needed to be fixed

- `Black and White` colors clearly seen
- `Save/Upload` file handling should be added
- `Win/Loss` function needed to be added
- `Enum` should be added
